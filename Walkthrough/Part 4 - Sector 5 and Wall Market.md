Recommended Level: |
--------------------
Cloud-LVL 11 |

Guide: So... Wanna know the truth? Saying yes gives more dialogue, and reveals
more of the story. It's likely that Cloud would say no, so that's what I
picked. We now have access to Aerith, and she's the exact opposite of Barret.
Her HP is VERY low, but her MP is incredibly high. How high? I'm certain that,
at one point, her MP will exceed her HP. Use her solely for magic unless I
say. And there might be a point where I'll say not to.

Oh, and Cloud's ego bubbles up here. I don't think Aerith is going to call him
God... When you get to the back room, Aerith will ask you if she could use her
magic to get out. But it'll cost you. DON'T DO IT. You need your money. The
escape is no different from the original game, so just play on. Also, do be
careful. Cloud has only 1 HP. Use a few Potions if you're worried. The party
gets fully healed once you reach the top.

When you reach the crossbeams at the very top, in the far right, is a shiny
brown dot. Run straight ahead, and then right to grab a Carob Nut. Then hop
on out of here.

Talk to Aerith once you gain control, and she'll give something depending on
how well you did in the soldier chasing minigame. If you did good, you'll get
a Restore Materia. If you perform very poorly, you'll get Moon sugar, Spider
web, High potion and Ether. Doing moderately good yields 4 sources (2 Magic+,
2 Mind+). Aim for the Restore Materia; VERY useful, link it to Spread and give
it to Aerith, and NEVER take it off of her.

Once Aerith tells you to go to her house, if you leave this screen and come
back, you'll see a moogle. He'll ask you some questions about other Final
Fantasy games. For each one you get right, you get an item. I don't know as
much as I thought, I only got 2 questions right. Oh, and don't worry about
Hidden Items. If you die, you have to fight Air Buster again, and the next
Save Point is in Wall Market, so we'll just wait until then, so you don't have
to grab them more than once.

The answers, rewards, and games to the questions are:

Q# - Answer - Reward - Game |
-----------------------------
Q1 - Masked Man - 2 High Potions - Final Fantasy IX |
Q2 - Dragon Whip - 2 Ethers - Final Fantasy IV |
Q3 - 30,000 Gil - 5 Antidotes - Final Fantasy I |
Q4 - Kaali - Energy Drink - Final Fantasy II |
Q5 - Speed +1 - 500 Gil - Final Fantasy VI |

Head over to Aerith's house, and sleep. Walk out, and head out to the entrance
to the F-ed up road. Into the playground, Aerith finds Tifa. And yes, I just
speedran those directions. You can go down the elephant slide (by crawling in)
and then letting Aerith do the same by talking to her. If you crawl into the
elephant slide and slide down with Aerith, you get 3 extra materia (Nuclear,
Analyse and Spirit+).

Be VERY careful here. Aerith is alone, and she is extremely weak. I got into
a fight with 4 Whole Eaters, and they killed her before I ran away :( Make
sure she has ALL available Spread materia equipped, and nothing else. Have her
defend if she should get into a fight, and throw a Smoke Bomb. If you get into
a pincer against 3 Whole Eaters, I can't guarantee your survival.

Upon entering Wall Market, you see Yuffie running out of the Materia shop. Oh,
Yuffie! She also appears in Sector 7 if you walk out on Tifa. Anyway, we now
have control of Cloud, so walk over to the Savepoint and save the hell out of
the game.

A quick look at the Hidden Items shows that you have 51 out of 93. Still no
prize, I see. Let's head back to Sector 5 (after re-equipping Aerith with
useful Materia), and let's grab some Hidden Items!

Outside of the church, there's a guy standing there. Don't talk to him; He will
steal 1000 gil if you have 1000 gil, otherwise he will steal nothing, up to 25
times. After the 25th time, you receive 2 Mako Potion and 2 Mako Ether. Try not
to get stolen, you need everything you can get. A Hidden Item is outside the Church:

2 Phoenix Downs:

On the next screen where you took the Nightmare Triva quiz, are 3 more Hidden
Items:

Potions:

![hdn_itm_53](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238466/6c6adc32-7889-11e4-9c3a-e5a0f6e60c53.jpg)

![hdn_itm_54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238468/6c6f546a-7889-11e4-8f83-7ba5caf34962.jpg)

![hdn_itm_55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238467/6c6f0d20-7889-11e4-8945-6eb4cafb165d.jpg)

That's a lot of Potions. On the next screen with the entrance to the F-ed up
road lies 3 more Hidden Items:

269 Gil:

![hdn_itm_56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238469/6c780506-7889-11e4-95dc-672c4faf387e.jpg)

Grenades:

![hdn_itm_57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238470/6c7a19d6-7889-11e4-9b56-4a57bd2658c6.jpg)

![hdn_itm_58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238472/6c7d5c54-7889-11e4-8a99-8f7898145f53.jpg)

On the screen with the Sector 5 Town lies 5 Hidden Items:

Potion:

![hdn_itm_59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238471/6c7c9404-7889-11e4-91df-1fc4e4757629.jpg)

Antidote:

![hdn_itm_60](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238473/6c8361f8-7889-11e4-9255-e3818325ab2e.jpg)

366 Gil

![hdn_itm_61](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238474/6c87746e-7889-11e4-99c7-3446c7934b06.jpg)

265 Gil:

![hdn_itm_62](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238475/6c89af68-7889-11e4-9e0f-ad95db76fd78.jpg)

42 Gil:

![hdn_itm_63](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238476/6c8d7b66-7889-11e4-9f36-4552b2d9fd68.jpg)

Into the house on the far right, on the bottom floor is one Hidden Item:

Energy Drink:

![hdn_itm_64](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238478/6c911154-7889-11e4-81b8-339143565c1e.jpg)

On the top floor is a Turtle's Paradise flyer. Read it, it's helpful! Talk to
the kid, open the hidden drawer, and don't take the 50 gil. You'll get a
better item later.

In the Item Shop (closest to where you exited) is a hidden item.

Mega Potion:

![hdn_itm_65](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238477/6c912608-7889-11e4-9d20-d933d22b1c32.jpg)

Nothing really grand enough to buy in the shop, unless you want more Grenades
or Phoenix Downs. In the Materia Shop is another Hidden Item.

4 Tranquilizers:

![hdn_itm_66](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238480/6c98d268-7889-11e4-8e39-d2e3cf7385ca.jpg)

At the Materia Shop, buy Transmute (Mini and Frog) and Cold (Ice), costing a
total of 7000 gil. You probably don't have much more than that. There's
Materia to buy in Wall Market too, and they're EXPENSIVE AS HELL. So we're
gonna do some money grinding after we find our Hidden Items.

At Aerith's house, there's 2 more Hidden Items, and 2 real items:

Moon Stone (Casts Regen):

![hdn_itm_67](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238479/6c98432a-7889-11e4-9fd4-f48b3857c830.jpg)

Sun Stone (Casts Barrier/MBarrier):

![hdn_itm_68](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238481/6c9ccee0-7889-11e4-92f3-ebd85efd762a.jpg)

At the top of the garden on the left is a purple dot. That's Guard, which is
Cover. Shove that onto Cloud. It really helps. We'll later give that to
Barret. At the bottom of the garden is an Ether.

Before we continue, let's do some Materia rearranging. We're going to set up
for money grinding a bit early, just because. Unequip all materia, then set
up Cloud and Aerith like this:

Cloud |
-------
Bolt=Guard |

Aerith |
--------
Transmute=Spread |
Rock=Spread |
Flame=Spread |

Transmute is so we can cast Mini on those who are susceptible to make fights
easier. Once you set everyone up, head into Aerith's house and rest. On the
floor with the bedrooms is a Hidden Item.

Antidote:

![hdn_itm_69](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238482/6ca5a056-7889-11e4-98e1-e71731c57566.jpg)

On the bottom floor are 2 Hidden Items:

Ether:

![hdn_itm_70](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238483/6ca743c0-7889-11e4-9cab-1171b8f68262.jpg)

High Potion:

![hdn_itm_71](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238484/6caa2298-7889-11e4-9990-f2b322341778.jpg)

Onto the F-ed up road, there are 4 Hidden Items, and 1 real item:

Grenade:

![hdn_itm_72](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238485/6cadab66-7889-11e4-8eb2-2457879f77ac.jpg)

Potion (I got pincer'd here by Whole Eaters, just a warning):

![hdn_itm_73](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238486/6cae377a-7889-11e4-9e10-075ebce30571.jpg)

222 Gil:

![hdn_itm_74](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238487/6cb4c07c-7889-11e4-9feb-090bfed805b7.jpg)

6 Gil:

![hdn_itm_75](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238488/6cb6e334-7889-11e4-82f8-034b93fc7221.jpg)

Head into the crane next to the pipe, and examine the controls to get a Luck
Plus materia. Stick that on Cloud.

At the playground, there's a few Hidden Items. I don't know the exact amount;
some of them are done irregularly. So I may miss a few here.

Tissue:

![hdn_itm_76](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238489/6cbe6622-7889-11e4-994d-50a90d5034dd.jpg)

Power+:

![hdn_itm_77](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238490/6cc1db54-7889-11e4-8796-601379531470.jpg)

Crawling into the little mouse near the entrance, you can find a High Potion.
I think the "Materia Get" sound effect is wrong... On to the transition
screen before Wall Market, lies 2 more Hidden Items:

Potion:

![hdn_itm_78](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238491/6cc3dd78-7889-11e4-925a-a4e01ce191e5.jpg)

28 Gil:

![hdn_itm_79](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238492/6cc44ed4-7889-11e4-8c66-31291906f50e.jpg)

On the first main Wall Market screen are 3 Hidden Items:

Steroids:

![hdn_itm_80](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238494/6cccbc9a-7889-11e4-9b06-bb64b001ce95.jpg)

High Potion:

![hdn_itm_81](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238493/6ccbf56c-7889-11e4-8872-e4ecaf4dd9a6.jpg)

Mutagen (Vaccine) (This one's a bit finnicky to get):

![hdn_itm_82](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238495/6ccf91e0-7889-11e4-9fca-4b9c6b10ea27.jpg)

Up one screen, to the next part of Wall Market, lies 3 Hidden Items:

Tent:

![hdn_itm_83](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238496/6cd28738-7889-11e4-828c-ddc5a90d001c.jpg)

Iron Bangle:

![hdn_itm_84](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238497/6cd67726-7889-11e4-8516-cc66a00d575f.jpg)

Mythril Saber:

![hdn_itm_85](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238498/6cdd74b8-7889-11e4-965d-255909bc7140.jpg)

Just sell the Mythril Saber; you should already have one. Alternatively, you
could skip out on buying one in Sector 7, and then get it for free here.

On the screen with the entrance to Corneo's place has 2 more Hidden Items:

638 Gil:

![hdn_itm_86](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238499/6ce6e066-7889-11e4-92a9-4070f48458fc.jpg)

Molotov Cocktail (It's spelled "Moletov Cocktail" in-game):

![hdn_itm_87](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238500/6ceb1fd2-7889-11e4-88c1-9e708a9f9628.jpg)

On the screen with the Shiny Wire of Hope is a Hidden Item.

571 Gil:

![hdn_itm_88](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238501/6ced5acc-7889-11e4-8dfc-aeb7248a7d03.jpg)

In the gym (where you do squats) has a Hidden Item:

Steroids:

![hdn_itm_89](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238502/6ced6ea4-7889-11e4-84ea-6db5487585cb.jpg)

In the restaurant next to the gym has a Hidden Item:

199 Gil:

![hdn_itm_90](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238503/6cf51c26-7889-11e4-942a-d1876bb768a4.jpg)

In the Inn (near the entrance to Wall Market) has 2 Hidden Items:

High Potion:

![hdn_itm_91](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238504/6d003a0c-7889-11e4-9917-cb7231a6e3a7.jpg)

Ether:

![hdn_itm_92](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238505/6d04da26-7889-11e4-8b84-db2c2c3dbed8.jpg)

In the restaurant (Where you get the Pharmacy Coupon) lies the final Hidden
Item for Wall Market:

Guard+ (Guard Source) (Don't sit down to get to this):

![hdn_itm_93](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238507/6d0be992-7889-11e4-8fc4-1b9f936108fe.jpg)

I'm certain you're more than tired of collecting Hidden Items, but looking at
all of this, that's a huge edge. Still no prize this time. These rewards get
very useful, I promise!

Currently, the Materia shop is closed, but this shop later sells some
Independent (Purple) materia. Most of them cost somewhere in the 20,000's. But
for now, we need to get some money.

First, run back to Sector 5, and buy whichever Materia you couldn't afford
earlier. Also head into the Weapon shop, buy 2 Steel Bangles and a Mythril
Rod, and equip the Mythril Rod on Aerith. It makes her magic stronger. Make
sure that Aerith has Transmute linked to Spread. We're gonna grind for money.

On the F-ed up road, one can encounter Whole Eaters and Hell Houses. You'll
wanna cast Magnify, which is Mini. It'll make the enemies here harmless (the
notable exceptions being the pincer with Whole Eaters, and the Whole Eaters'
Dual.)

When fighting Hell Houses, Magnify doesn't work. So have Aerith use Rock until
the Hell House is paralyzed (if at all). Then switch to Bolt. With the Whole
Eater's, Magnify-Spread, throw a Grenade, then use Spread-ed magic.

You'll want to fight until you have around 22000 Gil, as that's about how much
you'll need to do everything in Wall Market, and buy all the new equipment.

When you get all of the money, buy 1 Hard Edge, 1 Cannon Ball, 1 Full Metal
Staff, 3 Mythril Bangles, and 3 Fourty-Twos. The Fourty-Two (hahaha) doesn't
seem very useful, but it offers 4x Materia Growth. Equip it on both characters
and start leveling up all of your elemental materia. A good guideline is to
make sure all of your elemental materia is Level 2. If it happens to be
higher, great! But Level 2 will give you a grand edge. I was less patient and
sold 9 High Potions to buy the equipment. Yeah, don't sell any items. They're
all too useful. If you have more than 1 of a certain weapon, that's different.

The reason we want our elemental magic at Level 2 is because there's an effect
attached to each spell, and the level 2 version makes it much easier for them
to stick (about 4x more likely).

After spending 15,000 hours getting your money and your equipment, head to the
Honeybee Inn and talk to the guy with the white shirt near the entrance.
Select the first option, and you'll be pointed to Corneo's mansion. Let's go!

We're not allowed it because we have penises. Which is fine. Head to the dress
shop, and talk to the person behind the counter. Head up to the restaurant and
talk to the old guy on the right. Pick Sexy and Highclass. VERY important that
you do this. It's extremely important that you are picked for Corneo, else you
will have a tough(er) time getting to Aps in good condition.

There is an event in the north wall market. I'll leave you to figure this one
out. Search (and by that I mean, mash OK) around the trash near the weapon shop.
This can give you a Thief materia early (Aps does not have something to steal
but this will give you a second Thief materia in the sewers for maximum stealing power).

Head back to the dress shop and get the dress. Head to the gym, and do some
squats. It's the same as in the original game, very easy to win. You get the
Blonde Wig. Let's tone the woman up!

Head into the Materia shop, and we'll get our next objective. Go to the Inn,
sleep, and buy the most expensive thing. Counting the price of the thing, and
the cost of staying there, results in a 1200 Gil payment. Head back to the
Materia shop, and receive your reward, a Diamond Tiara. And extra thick
condoms are hilarious to me. I could never possibly think of a hotel nowadays
that sells that stuff. Kuugen has quite the imagination.

Head into the restaurant (Down and left to where you came out) and eat there.
Say "Pretty Good" to get a Pharmacy Coupon. Head into the item shop, and he'll
ask you what medicine you want. Pick Acucyline, and it'll give you the
Bisnafitorial. You want to get the Bisnafitorial; since the guy is stoned to
Heaven and messes up your command.

Head back to Sector 5, and in the town, up at the top is a guy with a hat
wearing a green sweater. Give him the Bisnafitorial, and he'll ask you how
much it cost. Say "Nothing", and he'll give you 2 Steroids.

Head back to Wall Market. In the bottom right is a fat guy. He has the
Members' Card, and we're gonna buy it. He wants 12,000 Gil for it. Don't buy
it (the text is off, so push "Down" and then "Confirm"). There's no reason to
pay that much. Talk to him again, and he'll offer 5000. Now that's reasonable.
Buy it, and let's enter the sex den.

Head into the "Wet and Fancy" room on the bottom left. Now there's bees
instead of the big fat greasy men. It's a bit... discomforting, for me anyway.
Now we have the Bikini Briefs. I'd have prefered a banana hammock, but Oh
Well.

Head into the top room, and the bee furthest from the exit will put makeup
on you. There's a Hidden Item in this room:

Phoenix Down:

![hdn_itm_94](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238506/6d0bb332-7889-11e4-9f64-781a7429d882.jpg)

Back in the main room, there's another Hidden Item:

667 Gil:

![hdn_itm_95](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238508/6d135ee8-7889-11e4-9a30-b3ac2500bd38.jpg)

I actually missed the picture for that one, that's why it looks different.
Before continuing, make sure you're Level 16. That was the level I was at when
I was done grinding. Anyway, head back to the dress shop, and... Go-Go Gadget
Cross-Dress! (I hope someone gets that)

Now that we're inside of the sex house, let's grab some Hidden Items! There's
1 Hidden Item in the main room, and 1 real item:

477 Gil:

![hdn_itm_96](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238509/6d21908a-7889-11e4-9d36-cd8fc65ceb22.jpg)

The real item is an Ether. It's behind the sign downstairs.

Torture Set (1/35 Soldier, Dropout Curse, Resizer, Basilisk Eye, and Sharp Tooth):

![hdn_itm_97](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5238510/6d34d3a2-7889-11e4-9998-fb6d289408c7.jpg)

Now, there's 6 Hidden Items we can't get at the moment if you get chosen by
Corneo. Don't worry, we'll get them later. When you're in Corneo's bedroom,
behind the bed is a Mega Potion (That doesn't lock your movement, by the way).
Talk to Corneo, Pick No, Pick Actually..., Try to leave, pick whatever option
you want, and we're in the sewers. Give everyone Steel Bangles, Give Aerith
your Rock Materia (which should have Level 2 unlocked), make sure someone
has Cold (also Level 2 unlocked), give Cloud the Hard Edge, Guard, and all of
your Spreads, heal up, and get ready for the toughest boss fight yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Aps |
-----
HP: 13333 |

Aps does not F around. Cloud is going to be our Tank, since the Hard Edge
increases his Vitality by 20. He has Guard, and the 3 Spreads, to up his
Vitality and HP as much as possible. He'll also be defending. Tifa is going
to be our physical attacker, which is why she has Luck+. Aerith is going to
be our magic user, and Aps is weak against Earth. We have Cold because it
inflicts Slow. We have Steel Bangles, because they Halve Water, something
that is vital against Sewer Tsunami.

Open the battle with a casting of Blizzard (Ice2), Tremor (Quake2), and a
physical from Tifa. Tremor deals about 700 damage, Blizzard deals about 325
damage, and Tifa's physical (or Triple Hit, which I got from Sewer Tsunami,
dealt about 600 damage. Sewer Tsunami dealt about 200 damage (which means
400 with the reverse one).

Have Cloud Defend after that, since Aps should now be slowed from Triple Hit
or Blizzard (Keep casting Blizzard if he isn't). He'll be our healer and tank
in this battle. Tifa should keep physically attacking, while Aerith keeps
using Tremor. To give yourself a big edge, have everyone use Energy Drinks
on themselves, and Steroids on Tifa. You can give her 4, to make the battle go
faster, but it's unnecessary.

If Aerith gets silenced from Sewer Tsunami, have someone throw a Voice
Enhancer, and the next person use an Antidote. If anyone gets Paralyzed from
the Sewer Tsunami, just wait it out. With an Energy Drink, it doesn't take
very long at all. If anyone has Fury from Sewer Tsunami... well, they'll
just get Limit Breaks faster.

Aps' final attack is both versions of Sewer Tsunami, back to back. With
Steel Bangles, and being healed near full health, and slamming Defend on
everyone, it's easily survivable. For winning, you get a Leviathan Soul.
Which is a new item. It's a VERY strong water attack. SAVE IT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe that fight was not as tough as I said. But it is if you're not prepared.
There's Hidden Items to get here, too. 2 of 'em. Near the trash by the gate,

Head up through the hole in the gate, and turn the red valve right in front of
you. You'll see a materia float down the stream. But HURRY! It'll disappear
eventually. It's Thief, which is Steal. Our most useful Materia yet. If you
wait a bit more, Steal+ and Speed+ (Increases dexterity) eventually come
floating.

You see, almost all bosses have stuff to steal. The Steal is SO much more
useful than the drop. But the steal rate is... rather low. About 5-20%,
depending on Level. This will result in lots and lots of stealing. But oh, is
it worth it.

At the save point, you should have 100 of 100 Hidden Items. Still no prize.
Not a problem, we'll get one soon. And that's where this next update will end.
See you in the next one!
