Guide: Alright, so hit "New Game" and get playin'! After the intro cutscene,
you'll see Zack there. Wait, Zack? Yeah, he's like a tutorial for this. Just
a bit of a briefing for what's ahead. Go ahead and read it, it's pretty cool.

Examine the first guard to get 2 Potions. Savor them. You have a ton of HP,
and Potions don't restore too much. Use them either sparingly or before a
character loses too much HP.

Your first fight is against 3 MP's. You have a Bolt-All and Jump Attack (a
modified Braver) ready to go. Open with Bolt-All, and then use the Jump
Attack, then start picking them off. You shouldn't need to heal.

In the next area, there are a few hidden items. Whenever a hidden item is
accessible, I will point you to the screenshot that came with this guide.
There are hundreds of hidden items littered about this mod, and let me tell
you, as difficult as this mod gets, you'll need everything you can get.

Anyway, there are 3 hidden items to pick up on this screen:

Energy Drink (Speed Drink):

100 Gil:

2 Grenades:

Step to the AVALANCHE members and give Cloud and Barret names. On the next
screen, there are 3 more hidden items:

Potion:

![hdn_itm_04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236340/31b8b0b2-7804-11e4-8861-1db27bc62650.jpg)

85 Gil:

![hdn_itm_05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236341/31bbc55e-7804-11e4-805e-ecbc9c610bfb.jpg)

2 Potions:

![hdn_itm_06](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236342/31bfb8ee-7804-11e4-935f-2d91dda72ae7.jpg)

Advance to the next screen. Then take the bridge up and into the reactor, and
Barret joins you. 2 more hidden items are on the screen where Barret joined
you:

50 Gil:

![hdn_itm_07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236343/31c48072-7804-11e4-8295-cc69cd153056.jpg)

Grenade:

![hdn_itm_08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236344/31c618e2-7804-11e4-8b6d-af46d336b6b5.jpg)

Especially these Grenades are important. You'll soon see why. Going to the
elevator, 3 Shinra Guards will charge out and attack you. I'll let you handle
this one, it's not so tough. Go into the elevator and take it down out into
the next screen.

Surprisingly, on this massive screen, there's just one hidden item:

Reactor Fragment (M-Tentacles):

![hdn_itm_09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236345/31c9c0dc-7804-11e4-9ba9-e8712478d5b0.jpg)

They seem useful, but keep them; they're useless against the first boss.
Proceed down the reactor, grabbing all items along the way, down to the save
point. Save points work a bit differently in Nightmare VII, and I'll explain
here in the next paragraph.

Omnipoints allow you to save, rest, and change your current party.
Regrouppoints allow you to save and change your current party.
Restockpoints allow you to rest and change your current party.
Securepoints allow you to save and rest.
Rest points allow you to rest.
Callpoints allow you to change your current party.
Savepoints allow you to save.
All save points let you check how many hidden items you have.

As you can see, not all save points let you save, which can be a big
hindrance. Resting requires a tent.

This Save Point right here is an Omnipoint. No point in resting, and even less
point changing your party, so save. If Cloud and Barret aren't at Level 7 yet,
run back up to the screen with the bridge (where Biggs is), and start grinding
there. When you think you're ready, run to the boss room, and initiate the
first boss fight of the mod.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss: Guard Scorpion                                                  |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
HP: 5000                                                              |
AI: Search Scope, Scorpion Tail, Search Scope, Rifle, {Raise} {Lower} |

Strategy: Few things to note before the battle begins. See the section above
this, where it says "AI"? That's going to be his chance of using a certain
attack being used, or, if he has a pattern, it will be his pattern. Second,
note the 30 minute timer. Not to worry, you can beat the Guard Scorpion, and
be out of here in about 10 minutes. But he has 5000 HP! How in the hell are we
going to do this in that amound of time?

Grenades deal an incredible amount of damage in this mod, and they hit all
enemies. If you got a Bolt Plume, save them; Grenades deal more damage. These
will be your best friend during Midgar, so stock up while grinding!

Whoever Guard Scorpion targets with Search Scope, have them defend, and have
the other character use a Grenade. Search Scope inflicts Paralysis, so we're
having that character defend to lessen the damage dealt. Barret has plenty
of HP, but Cloud... not so much. Even so, Defend anyway. After he attacks,
have Cloud and Barret throw grenades. Repeat for the second Search Scope.

When he raises his tail, do NOT attack! His Tail Laser inflicts Confusion,
Silence, Mini, Berserk, Paralysis, and Darkness. If that's not bad enough, it
reduces the party's HP to 1, "Heartless Angel" style. It's an instant Game
Over, so avoid that at all costs. Repeat the process until he dies.

His final attack is Tail Laser. Which is harmless. Everyone's HP is restored
to 201 after the fight, so heal up!

For winning this fight, you get a cannon shell. Which is an 8-Inch Cannon.
Keep that around; you may need it for a later fight...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before leaving, the final hidden item of the reactor is in the boss room:

Assault Gun:

![hdn_itm_10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236346/31ced7d4-7804-11e4-9882-320d576a40ef.jpg)

A treasure chest appears near the Omnipoint (which disappeared, to add another
layer of intensity), containing 5 Smoke Bombs. Useful for running away, but
for some reason, running away from battles is locked sometimes, so they can't
always be relied on.

The biggest change is when you get to the stairs in the large room (with the
Reactor Fragment). Biggs has killed 2 Shinra Soldiers, and he needs your help.
Run over and talk to him, and he'll get up and start running. Cloud will
automatically pick up a Phoenix Down from a dead soldier. Biggs will warn you
that Shinra Soldiers are coming. You now have a choice. Run or Hide.

You want to run, mashing the circle button (like the prompt says), stopping at
the elevator. You'll get in a fight with 6 soldiers. Throw 2 Grenades, and you
win. The rest of the escape is not different, so run out and let's proceed
with the game.
