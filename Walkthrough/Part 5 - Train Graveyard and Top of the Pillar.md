Potion, 3 Voice Enhancers, Technowhale Flesh

Materia: Spread

Recommended Level: Cloud-LVL 16  Tifa-LVL 14  Aerith-LVL 16

Guide: Through the first train, near the barrel is a High Potion. Climb up the
ladder. In the second barrel is a Dark urge. Go across the broken beam, and on
the train near the exit, you'll see a white dot. That's a potion. There are 3
Hidden Items on this screen:

Head through the trains and onto the next screen. In the barrel on the left
is an Energy Drink. There are 3 Hidden Items and a materia to grab.

hdn_itm_104.jpg - 53 Gil
hdn_itm_105.jpg - 112 Gil
hdn_itm_106.jpg - 72 Gil

When you get in the one train to push the other, pull the first train back,
and you'll see a Materia on the ground. It's a Spread. Follow the path back
to Sector 7. Haven't you missed this place?

After the cutscene, check the Hidden Items. You should have 106 out of 106.
Our next prize is awarded. It is 10 Lixir's. Basically 10 X-Potions. Quite
useful. You're not fully healed at this point, like in the original game, but
that's ok. Save your game, and scale the tower. There's 2 Hidden Items on the
first screen:

The amount of stairs to climb to reach the next screen has increased. It's
not that bad. Climb until you reach the next screen, and control will switch
to Aerith in Sector 7.

Head into 7th Heaven, and Aerith will call for Marlene. Head back a screen
(to the crossroads) and head down to wind up in the playground. Follow the
path back to Aerith's house. Make sure Marlene doesn't get caught on anything.
She has to be near Aerith, or else you can't proceed to the next screen.

When you get to Aerith's house, Tseng is there. If you wanna fight, choose
"Marlene, quick!". You'll have a pincer against 6 Shinra Soldiers. It's very
likely you'll die here, but it's not Game Over. I don't know what happens if
you win, I've never been able to. Control now shifts back to Cloud and Tifa at
the pillar.

On this second screen (with Jessie and Barret), there is a Hidden Item. You
have to run back down and get it.

hdn_itm_109.jpg - 3 Voice Enhancers

Up near Barret, examine the mob of dead soldiers and you'll get 100 Gil 5
times, and 10 Gil 5 times, for a total of 550 Gil. Talk to Barret, and let's
set up for our next boss fight.

Give Cloud the Buster Sword, Tifa the Metal Knuckle, and Barret the Cannon
Ball. Give everyone a Fourty-Two. Cloud should be your highest leveled
character, so give him your Thief materia. Give Barret Guard and as many
Spread's as you can. Make sure someone has Blizzard, fully heal everyone, and
let's fight Reno!

Reno
HP: 10000

Whenever someone gets trapped in a Pyramid, throw a Green Ooze. It'll kill
the Pyramid and Poison Reno (hopefully). Have Cloud Steal from Reno until you
get the Shinra Limited Edition (which I got on my second try). Using Limit
Breaks and Green Oozes when necessary, along with Reno being poisoned and
slowed (from Blizzard), he'll fall very quickly.

After Reno's demise, there is a Hidden Item on the screen:

hdn_itm_110.jpg - Technowhale Flesh (It's behind the pillar, in the oval).

Anyway, let's look at our new prize, the Shinra Limited Edition! It's a very
good piece of armor for this point in the game. This is something you'd find
in the Underwater Reactor! It halves Fire, Ice, Bolt, Poison, and makes the
wearer immune to Poison. The text incorrectly says sleep, it's supposed to be
poison. This armor is going to be especially useful for our next boss fight...

Follow the story until you're supposed to go to Aerith's house. Head back to
Wall Market and save. That's it for this update!
