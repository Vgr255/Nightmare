Guide: So... Wanna know the truth? Either option doesn't matter. Aerith the
Flower Girl is here, and she is a goddess of Magic. She has about 450 MP, and
incredibly high magic. She's our magician, sure enough!

Oh, and Cloud's ego bubbles up here. I don't think Aerith is going to call him
God... When you get to the back room, Aerith will ask you if she could use her
magic to get out. But it'll cost you. DON'T DO IT. You need your money. The
escape is no different from the original game, so just play on. Also, do be
careful. Cloud has only 1 HP. Use a few Potions if you're worried. The party
gets fully healed once you reach the top.

When you reach the crossbeams at the very top, in the far right, is a shiny
brown dot. Run straight ahead, and then right to grab a Carob Nut. Then hop
on out of here.

Talk to Aerith once you gain control, and she'll give you a Restore Materia.
VERY useful, link it to Spread and give it to Aerith, and NEVER take it off
of her.

Once Aerith tells you to go to her house, if you leave this screen and come
back, you'll see a moogle. He'll ask you some questions about other Final
Fantasy games. For each one you get right, you get an item. I don't know as
much as I thought, I only got 2 questions right. Oh, and don't worry about
Hidden Items. If you die, you have to fight Air Buster again, and the next
Save Point is in Wall Market, so we'll just wait until then, so you don't have
to grab them more than once.
