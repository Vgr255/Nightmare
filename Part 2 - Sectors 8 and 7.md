Guide: After the bomb explodes and the mini-speech, we have hidden items to
pick up:

hdn_itm_11.jpg - Grenade
hdn_itm_12.jpg - Grenade
hdn_itm_13.jpg - Grenade
hdn_itm_14.jpg - Potion

Lots of Grenades. Up the stairs, and on to the next screen. After the talk
with the flower lady, two more hidden items to pick up:

hdn_itm_15.jpg - Potion
hdn_itm_16.jpg - Ether

On the next screen, we have two hidden items, and one actual item:

hdn_itm_17.jpg - 250 Gil
hdn_itm_18.jpg - Green Ooze (Deadly Waste)

Oh, the actual item is 3 Potions. When you head down to the next screen, DON'T
MOVE. On the left side of the screen is a hidden item, and it's very easy to
miss. If you head down too far, and you didn't get the item, you can never get
this again.

hdn_itm_19.jpg - Cannon Shell (8-Inch Cannon)

Don't fight the battles, conserve your resources. On the train, there's a
hidden item. A very useful one.

hdn_itm_20.jpg - 1000 Gil

No hidden items on the train. Once you arrive at Sector 7, don't worry about
Hidden Items; we'll want to grab all of those later, it'd be too confusing if
we try it now. For now, just proceed with the story until Tifa's in your
party. Gotta give Tenko Kuugen props for utilizing the removed scene. You'll
know what I mean if you pick "Yeah I'm going".

Shortly before you gain control, you'll get a message about Time Chests. The
items you get can be different depending on when you pick them up. I'll try
my best to let you know if there is a time chest.

A quick Hidden Item check at the Savepoint will reveal that you (should) have
20 Hidden Items out of 34. The screen on the far right (The Train Graveyard)
does have some (including a materia), but we can't get to them until later.
I'll get to managing Materia in a second.

Here are all of the hidden items in sector 7. You should know where all of
these places are:

hdn_itm_21.jpg - Energy Drink
hdn_itm_22.jpg - 100 Gil
hdn_itm_23.jpg - 65 Gil
hdn_itm_24.jpg - Molotov Cocktail (Molotov)
hdn_itm_25.jpg - Void Debris
hdn_itm_26.jpg - Salamander Stone
hdn_itm_27.jpg - Jupiter Piece
hdn_itm_28.jpg - Reactor Fragment
hdn_itm_29.jpg - 2 Smoke Bombs
hdn_itm_30.jpg - Jessie's Bomb (This is a Landmine, which is an S-Mine)
hdn_itm_31.jpg - 74 Gil
hdn_itm_32.jpg - Assault Gun
hdn_itm_33.jpg - 144 Gil
hdn_itm_34.jpg - Steroids

To get the last hidden item, either refuse to sleep there, or accept, and once
Cloud wakes up, walk over and grab it. At this point, if you go back to (any)
Save Point and check your hidden item count, you (should have 34, and) will be
awarded 2000 Gil. VERY useful for the coming trials and tribulations.

I know you've probably spent long enough here in Sector 7, but we're still not
done. We gotta do shopping. Go into the Item Shop, and buy 30 Grenades, 10
Voice Enhancers, and about 5 Antidotes. Everyone should have full limit gauges
from the Guard Scorpion's Tail Laser. Tifa starts with her's full.

Buy 3 Iron Bangles, and, if you have the money, buy a Mythril Saber for Cloud.
You shouldn't need to buy an Assault Gun; you already have two. It's very
important that you buy 3 of every single piece of armor. Each of them has a
unique effect, usually resisting one element or another. It's incredibly
useful, and almost mandatory in some battles. Don't bother equipping the
Mythril Saber, it drastically lowers Cloud's Strength.

On the second floor, grab the Spread materia (This is an All materia), and
grab the Ether that falls in the chest after. That's all for items. Now... up
for some grinding?

Before that, Materia needs to be set. You should have Bolt, Flame, and 2
Spreads. Give Cloud Bolt-Spread, and give Tifa Flame-Spread. This is how we're
going to be grinding, saving our limit breaks for Air Buster. Don't use your
items; They're all extremely important.

You probably have a small amount of gil. Well, maybe a few thousand. In order
to make some fights later on easier, we're gonna need some extra levels. So
I'm going to recommend that you go into the Train Graveyard, and grind until
Cloud, Barret, and Tifa are Level 10 or so. This WILL take a while. But this
will ensure that the rest of Midgar is easy. If you aren't interested in the
grinding, by all means, continue with the game. Gaining Levels does make the
game easier...

Oh, and don't bother trying for new Limits. Want an example? To learn Cloud's
1-2 Limit Break, Jump Attack must be used ~55 times. Yeah. That's gonna take
a while. Anyway, whenever you're ready, board the train and let's get out of
Sector 7.
