Guide: The story proceeds as normal until you jump off the train. Let me begin
by saying you WANT to make it to the end of the train. For making it to the
end, this ensures you go through as few screens as possible to get to the
reactor. Be sure to talk to the guy in the back on the first screen for a
Phoenix Pinion, and talk to the guy near the exit on the second screen for 2
High Potions.

But even then, that's still an incredible 60 SCREENS to go through. It takes
forever, but that's not the tough part. Wait until we get to the door guarding
Air Buster!

Once you jump off the train, rather than heading forward, start going back
until you come to a dead end. There's a guy here, whom I'm sure you don't
recognize. But for now, this guy will be more helpful than you think. He'll
talk about how he's been following you, and has a package for you. He'll first
ask you if you want Health, Magic, or 4 Statuses. These items are 10 High
Potions, 5 Ethers, 10 Antidotes, 10 Voice Enhancers, 10 Kisses, and 10
Rockmelts. The only worthwhile set here is the High Potions, so pick those.

Next, He'll ask you what materia you want. Burning, Freezing, Electrocution,
and Paralyzing. These are Flame, Ice, Bolt, and Rock. You already have Flame
and Bolt, so we'll rule those out. Rock is very useful against Aps, as he's
weak to Earth. Several of the next bosses are either resistant to Ice, or
nullify it altogether, so Rock is the best choice. There is also a hidden
item here.

Power+ (Power Source):

![hdn_itm_35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236493/2f20fbc0-7809-11e4-806e-86bfe861e047.jpg)

If you talk to him now, he'll give you 10 Eye Drops. Then he'll teleport you
further into the tunnels. Just walk back. You'll get some useful items that
way.

About halfway through, there will be an intersection with two guards. "Wait
for a miracle", and then "Wait for it" to proceed. I wonder if everyone in
Shinra is like those two.

At this point, you can turn around, and kill the Shinra soldiers, provoking
more random battles from more Shinra soldiers (this is a feature in the
original game). Fight about 4 groups, and you'll regain control. Go inside,
sneak in the vent, and you'll get a Potion, High Potion, Mega Potion, Ether,
and Mega Ether. You'll also appear at the screen past the laser beams. Just in
case you didn't take this route...

When you finally get to the laser beams, hop down the chute to the left. Grab
the 3 Ethers in front of you. Jump down the ladder, and there's a hidden item
on the twisty walkway.

2 Fury Fragments:

Down the ladder, there are 5 hidden items. And one regular item.

455 Gil:

![hdn_itm_37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236495/2f27c0c2-7809-11e4-9f81-76131046b96a.jpg)

4 Smoke Bombs:

5 Potions:

3 High Potions:

![hdn_itm_40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236498/2f3228f0-7809-11e4-864d-ad80aa5e30b9.jpg)

2 Ethers:

![hdn_itm_41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236499/2f34797a-7809-11e4-8bfa-e58979562820.jpg)

Over by Wedge is a Lixir. It's a red dot on the ground, in between two boxes.
Talk to Wedge, and he'll give you a Lixir as well. Up the middle ladder, in
the next room is a Mega Potion. Or a Mako Potion, depending on when you grab
it. I don't know when.

Down the ladder to the left, talk to Biggs, and he'll give you 2 Energy
Drinks. Grab the Tent, and then climb up the ladder. BEFORE YOU SLIDE DOWN,
there is a hidden item on this platform.

Green Ooze:

![hdn_itm_42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236500/2f38e0d2-7809-11e4-94c8-0fe742010d91.jpg)

Don't worry about other hidden items, we'll grab those in a second. Run down,
plant the bomb, and utilize the Omnipoint. Don't rest yet; Chances are, you'll
be in a worse spot soon.

In the room with the bomb, there is a useful hidden item:

Metal Knuckle:

![hdn_itm_43](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236501/2f3b4804-7809-11e4-98df-e7b785f370c5.jpg)

Go ahead and put that on Tifa. Near the Omnipoint, there is another hidden
item.

2 Antidotes:

![hdn_itm_44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236502/2f416f9a-7809-11e4-9e43-0e1a368a8bf6.jpg)

Up the ladder, there's another hidden item on the pipe curving up.

2 Grenades:

![hdn_itm_45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236503/2f43a2d8-7809-11e4-9e9d-99eabc3f360d.jpg)

Taking a look at the Omnipoint, there are a total of 51 Hidden Items to find.
Currently, we have 45, so the other 6 should not be a problem. Also, have
Barret or Tifa throw your Grenades. They'll do the most damage with them. In
fights you can't escape from, you'll want to have Barret or Tifa throw a
Grenade, and if any survivor's remain, Bolt-All and Ember-All. Everyone's
limit gauges should still be full. Keep 'em that way until I say so.

On the next screen, there is another hidden item.

Ether:

![hdn_itm_46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236504/2f470ed2-7809-11e4-8293-9a912049d461.jpg)

On the screen with the big structure (where you slid down) are 2 more hidden
items.

Reactor Fragment:

![hdn_itm_47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236505/2f4a6582-7809-11e4-943a-48dcb9e3f890.jpg)

Green Ooze:

![hdn_itm_48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236506/2f4e9698-7809-11e4-9eb7-a82d5218233a.jpg)

On the top floor is a big structure. Climb up, and there is a Spread Materia.
Very useful. Up the elevator, into the big room with the exit to Air Buster,
is 3 hidden items:

2 Phoenix Downs:

![hdn_itm_49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236507/2f51c11a-7809-11e4-8c08-6d16041058ef.jpg)

228 Gil:

![hdn_itm_50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236508/2f5644a6-7809-11e4-8be9-fa93ba7e6061.jpg)

197 Gil:

![hdn_itm_51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4260395/5236509/2f58ca1e-7809-11e4-80ed-ba0df8f14e88.jpg)

The button minigame has been drastically altered. For one thing, the amount
of time Tifa and Barret will wait has been increased. They will wait for 70
frames, which is a little over a second. Every time you fail, you must face
a pincer against 3 red dogs which can inflict Berserk and make this last a
very long time. Should you get into this fight, throw a Grenade at the side
with 2 dogs, and start casting magic.

If you fail 10 times, Cloud and Barret slam the button, and the door opens.
Hopefully, that doesn't happen. I got it on my 5th try last time.

Open the chest with 5 High Potions. Run back down and save it and use the Tent
if you want. There's no Save Point near Air Buster, so this is the closest
one. You don't get a prize for reaching 51 Items, sadly. Run to the top, watch
the cutscene, and let the battle begin!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Buster
HP: 15000

Air Buster is the first real tough fight in Nightmare VII. His Big Bomber is
a force to be reckoned with. Fortunately, he can only use it 4 times.

Everyone's Limit Gauges should still be full. Let's fix that. Open with
everyone's limit breaks, starting with Barret, then Cloud, and then Tifa. For
some reason, Tifa's reels are all "Yeah!", so it's really easy to work.

At the level I was at, everyone's limit breaks' combined dealt 6000 damage.
Let me tell you, THAT was a surprise! We'll be attacking with Limit Breaks
in this fight, and you want to use a character's limit break when Air Buster
attacks the side OPPOSITE of the character who has the Limit Break. This way,
it hits Air Buster's back, and it deals a lot of damage. In every other
circumstance, just heal.

If Air Buster won't attack someone when you want to, just have someone on the
other side attack Air Buster, and he'll turn (even if he doesn't attack), and
then use the Limit Break.

For winning, you get a Steel Bangle, which is a Titan Bangle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now Cloud will fall down. On to the business in Sector 5!
