Go straight to Kalm. I'm sure you're tired of fighting, and ready to kick some
ass. Well, that's what we're gonna do. Go up in the Inn, and let's have a
flashback. Harp noise.

(Also, note at this point that I will no longer mention Hidden Items. There
are no more placed.)

This is the moment I've been waiting for since I began this guide. The
Sephiroth flashback is one of my favorite parts of Final Fantasy VII. I can't
wait to see how strong Sephiroth is! (I've never made it this far before, this
was a blind run).

Sephiroth has about 8000 HP and over 1000 MP (due to Menu Overhaul). Look at
the damage Sephiroth can do! I almost fell out of my chair!

Play through the flashback up to the Nibel Bridge (where everyone falls off).
Let's check out Sephiroth's stuff! It's pretty unique that every time
Sephiroth attacks, he inflicts Death Sentence. Let's continue!

Play through the story up to the reactor. When the pod bursts open, we have a
boss to fight!

Sample: H0215 |
---------------
HP: 100000 |

This fight is impossible to lose, since Sephiroth takes no damage. Do whatever
you want in this fight, it won't matter.

Sephiroth went nuts, and read a bunch of books. Now he's gonna go get Jenova,
and finish the job Jenova started.

Wonder how strong HE'S gonna be at the end of the game.

Anyway, see the flashback through to its conclusion. It's interesting what's
happening with Cloud...

...and that's where the story ends. The story (and the Hidden Items) are only
done up to this point. We still have a whole disc of content to sift through.
But from here on, we only need to worry about bosses.

Head into the house next to the Inn. Under the stairs is a Power+. One house
over, head upstairs. In the cabinet is a Guard+. One house over, head in the
back and go up the spiral staircase. There is the Peacemaker, a weapon for
Vincent. Head up the other stairs, and there is a Guard+ in the cabinet next
to the girl.

In the house to the far right, under the stairs is a Luck+. Now, let's buy
some items. You are probably DYING for some Healing items. Thankfully, the
shop here sells High Potions. But damn, they're expensive. Buy 15 High
Potions. Head one shop over. We'll get to the Materia store in a minute. At
the Weapon shop, lots of stuff. Lots of *cheap* stuff.

Buy an Atomic Scissors, a Grand Glove, a Striking Staff, and 2 Carbon Bangles.
500 Gil. Very worth it. Over at the Materia Store, we have some new stuff to
buy, and undoubtedly, some money to get. We need...

1 Nuclear, 1 Analyze, 1 Gene, 1 Chronus, 1 Alterate, and 1 Mental. That comes
out to 62280 Gil. We're gonna get the money now.

Make sure you know Rocket Blast, which is Matra Magic. Also learn MP Dynamite.
You learn them in the same places as in the original game.

Run back and forth, fighting the Prowlers. Occasionally, they'll steal stuff
from you, but just kill them and you'll get it back. Buy one of each of the
Materia above.

Nuclear is Bio, Bio2, and Bio3. Analyze is Sense and Morph. Gene is Poisona
and Esuna. Chronus is Slow, Haste, and Stop, Alterate is Nightmare and
something else (Nightmare is Poison/Sleep). Mental is Mindcrash and something
else (Mindcrash is Slow-Numb/Slow). All very useful additions to our ranks.

Use a Tent. We have a boss to prepare for. Another Hardcore exclusive.

A Wind elemental attack on this boss = Instant Death. Unfortunately, we're all
out of those. So it's a straight up brawl with a strong boss.

Give Cloud the Mythril Saber, Iron Bangle, and the Accelerator. Give Barret
the Assault Gun, Shinra Limited Edition, and the Tornado Pendant. Give Tifa
the Mythril Claw, Iron Bangle, and Flame Ring. Set up your Materia like this:

Cloud: |
--------Thief=E.Skill |
Magic+=Speed+ |
Alterate=Holy- |

Barret: |
---------
Thief |
Guard=Spread |
Spread=Spread |
Spread=Power+ |

Tifa: |
-------
Chronus |
Power+=Nuclear |

Fully heal, save, and talk to the Chocobo's. They'll spit out the Choco/Mog
materia, and BAMF. Boss Time.

Silver Chocobo |
----------------
HP: 99999 |

If you NEVER attack him, he won't do anything. He'll just sit there like a
dumbass and stare at you. But that's boring. We're gonna use MP Dynamite to
rid the Silver Chocobo of its ability to use Choco/Mog constantly. If you can,
learn Chocobuckle. It's not very much use, but it's something.

There's a 50% Chance MP Dynamite it'll miss, although it seems like so much
more. 1000 MP Damage means we need it to hit 10 times. That completely drains
him of his MP, rendering him useless. Just know that it takes a while. Be wary
of his counter attack. It inflicts Stop, and it deals heavy damage. If it ends
up to be Fat Chocobo instead of Deathblow, everyone will die except Barret. It
deals a fixed 5000 Damage.

You need to hit him with MP Dynamite 10 times. At that point, he'll be out of
options. At this point, steal from him until you get the Chocobo Spirit. Then
do whatever you want to kill him, just don't use items. This method took me
about an hour. So don't take this if you're impatient. Stick something on the
confirm button and go do something else for an hour. That oughta do it just
fine.


Our prize, the Chocobo Spirit, is very useful, but very limited. It gives an
absolutely MASSIVE 150 Dexterity boost!! The downfall of this, though, is that
only a few people can equip it. Tifa, Red XIII, and 2 other people we don't
have yet. The wearer cannot be healed.

Before we continue, let's get the Chocobo Lure Materia. The price says 5000.
But it hasn't been reduced yet. So it still deducts only 2000. It doesn't add
or subtract anything from any stats. It's sorta just there.

Go to the Mythril Mines (I trust you know a way around the Zolom). In the
Mines on the right screen, lies the Range+ Materia, which is Long Range. After
picking it up, you are thrust into a fight. And then another one. And another.
And another. 4 fights total. None of them are too tough. Climb down the vine.

Go up the stairs to find 2 Tents. One is in a Potion, another is in a chest.
Head back a screen. On the other path, head down, and to the right is a chest
with a Guard+. We have a boss fight to set up for.

We need to protect against Petrify and Confusion. We can't really do that on
everyone, though. Give Cloud the Mythril Saber, the Copper Bangle, and the
Tornado Pendant. Give Barret the Assault Gun, the Copper Bangle, and the
Flame Ring. Give Tifa the Metal Knuckle, the Chocobo Spirit, and the Backup
System. Set up your Materia like this:

Cloud: |
--------
Thief=Chocobo |
Chronus=Magic+ |
E.Skill |

Barret: |
---------
Luck+=Holy- |
Spread |
Guard |

Tifa: |
-------
Power+=Range+ |
Speed+ |

This gives Tifa a fearsome 221 Dexterity. Turn the Battle Speed down to the
lowest, and the benefit would be optimal. Use a Tent, save, and let's enter
a surprise boss fight.

Rude |
------
HP: 34800 |

Elena |
-------
HP: 27630 |

Beware of Rude's shoulder tackle. It deals 2500 damage in the back row. That's
VERY dangerous. Give Tifa an Energy Drink and a Steroids to make her much
faster and tougher.

Elena counter-attacks EVERYTHING. And that's very annoying. Use Paradog to
slow her down. Rude's Grand Spark can deal an incredible 4500 damage. For this
reason, I'm going to advise against stealing in this fight. If you're feeling
brave, they each have a Shinra Limited Edition. You only really need one, so
you have a complete set.

Time to put all of your Skooma's to good use. Use one, and Elena will be
confused. Have Cloud use Rocket Blast. Have Barret Defend. If someone dies,
use Raise or a Phoenix Down, This should settle into a comfortable rhythm of
Skooma, Rocket Blast, Phoenix Down, Rocket Blast, Skooma, depending on how
often Elena breaks out of Confusion.

When Elena falls, Rude won't be too far behind. Use a Void Debris. At this
point, things got intense for me, since Barret died, and I ran out of Phoenix
Downs and High Potions. If it falls to Tifa, just attack physically. Most of
Rude's attacks will miss. For winning, you get a Mega Lixir.


In the room behind you are 2 more Tents. Head out of the Mythril Mines, and go
straight to Fort Condor. Join the fight, climb down the ladder to the beds,
and let's rest. Save, too. We have some more Materia and Items to buy.

At the Materia Store, we need 1 Restore, 1 Space, 1 Gravity, and 1 Protect.
At the Item Store, we need 3 Mutagens. This adds up to 54,500. We'll get the
money when we get Yuffie. Give Cloud a Fourty-Two, and stick our new Restore
in there. We need to eliminate the need of High Potions, or else we're gonna
be broke the whole game.

Let's go get Yuffie! Find her in a forest, like usual.

Yuffie |
--------
HP: Varies |

Use a Limit Break. She'll probably die. If not, it'll probably take a few more
physical attacks.


Pick Not Interested, Petrified, Wait a Second, That's Right, Let's Hurry, and
you'll have Yuffie in your group. She has very low HP and even less MP. For
now, let's stick with Cloud, Barret, and Tifa. It's a good mix of HP, MP, and
stats.

Head back into the Mythril Mines, and head into the room with Range+. Fight
enemies here until you have 14,000 Gil. Go buy Gravity. Then go back to Kalm
and use our old money grinding strategy to get the rest. Be sure to use your
Fourty-Two's and level up your Magic Materia! It's more helpful than you
think!

Also, grab an extra 10,000-15,000 Gil. We're gonna do a Fort Condor battle,
and the values for each soldier have been increased. To give a tutorial for
Fort Condor would take 20,000 years. I trust you know what you're doing, but
if you don't, here's what you should do:

At the start (before the actual battle begins), Place a Catapult at the red
line (It's near the point where the little pointer finger turns red). Then,
start the game. Go down until the finger turns red, and place another
Catapult. Head down until the finger turns red, and place another. Place an
Attacker, and send him to attack the Stilva that shows up. Head all the way to
the left, and you'll see another Stilva. Place an attacker there, too. They'll
kill the Stilva's before any more enemies show up, and you'll win with very
little effort.

For this first fight, you get a Magic Comb, a weapon for Red XIII. We're
almost set for Junon. But first, we're going to do our first of many battle
checks. With the shops giving more Materia, this is going to allow us to rely
less and less on items, and more and more on Magical and Physical
Augmentation. Every once in a while (usually from one major event to another).
I'll give a battle check, and reveal my current Levels and Materia Levels.
Sort of like the recommended level thing I've been doing, but more in-depth.

Total Game Time: 28:50 (28 Hours and 50 Minutes, Now THAT's dedication!)

*Yes, that's pretty insane dedication indeed.*

As you can see, we're gaining a healthy set of Magic Materia. We have another
boss to set up for. Let's Gooooooo!

A Backup System or Mutagens are REQUIRED. Or else the next boss' final attack
will inflict Instant Death across the whole party. Other than that, we're not
gonna need much. Give Cloud the Hard Edge, a Carbon Bangle, and the Flame
Ring. Give Barret the Atomic Scissors, a Carbon Bangle, and the Backup System.
Give Tifa the Grand Glove, a Carbon Bangle, and the Charm (It's on Yuffie).
Set up your Materia like this:

Cloud: |
--------
Nuclear |

Barret: |
---------
Guard=Analyze |

Tifa: |
-------
Restore |

Like I said, we do not need much. We're gonna do the Poison-Tank strategy, as
our next boss has tons and tons of Defense, Magic Defense, and HP. Save
outside of Junon, and head inside. Go to the shop near the stairs and buy 3
Shinra V2.17's. Head down the stairs to the beach. We've got some fishing
to do.

Bottomswell |
-------------
HP: 55820 |

Use Radiation until Bottomswell is poisoned. Have Tifa use Restore whenever
someone gets hit. Have Barret and Cloud Defend. Never attack Bottomswell
again. Once he's poisoned, have Tifa use Restore when Barret's HP drops below
6000. Use it on Cloud if he drops below 2000, and Tifa if she drops below
2500. You should only need to use 1 Ether.

When Bottomswell runs out of HP, he'll use Deadly Tsunami, an attack that
deals no damage and inflicts Instant Death on everyone. Barret has the Backup
System, so it won't affect him. For winning, you get a Strength Bangle, an
accessory that increases your strength by 50.


You'll have to do CPR on Priscila. It takes 41 breaths to revitalize her. Each
"Lift" on the CPR Gauge counts as one. Head back out to the world map and
save.
